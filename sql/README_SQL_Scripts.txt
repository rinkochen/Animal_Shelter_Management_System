/*
Difference between .sql scripts:
SQLCreate.sql contains only the tables and constaints (no inserting sample data)
SQLInsert.sql contains only the insert statements for sample data.
SQLComplete.sql includes both the schema (tables and constraints) and sample data (insert values) to recreate the default state of your database.
